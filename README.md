# openssl-evp-cpp

This is a introduction project showcasing how to use the OpenSSL EVP API (openssl/evp.h) for implementing various cryptographic techniques using c++. The project focuses on utilizing the API for:

    Hashing: Securely hashing data with various algorithms.
    Generating Keys: Creating cryptographic keys for signing, encryption, and decryption tasks.
    Signing: Using private keys to sign data for authentication.
    Verifying: Verifying signatures to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

This project serves as an introduction to the powerful cryptographic features provided by OpenSSLâ€™s EVP API.
